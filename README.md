# CPUID for Anti-vm
This repo is a collection of codes which implements the "CPUID" instruction to identify virtualized environments.</br>

## Important
**I do not recommend compiling it from the `.sln` file, just copy the codes into your own.** </br></br>
But if you're willing to, don't forget: </br></br>
In `Project properties > C/C++ > Code Generation`, change "Runtime Library" field to: **Multi-threaded (/MT)** </br></br>
